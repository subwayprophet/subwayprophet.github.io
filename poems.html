	<h1>poems</h1>

	<h2>programmer god</h2>
	<pre>no triangle
		no entry
	instead a filter
		bracket pointy down
	not build, but discipline
	reduce to act,
		no creating
	the engineer
		over the demiurge
	as if from plenum,
		the axiom of the lambda
		derivation is humility,
		analysis is complete making
	i kill with names,
		saturating boxes
		determining void,
		and with a poke
			the thing runs itself</pre>

	<h2>silicon trickle</h2>
	<pre>it isn't from me
		or anything
	it always bootstraps
	and its condition is no exit
		except arbitrarily
	a function is a thing
	an action is an object
	it's combinators
		all the way down
	i'm not a channel
	it's less than atoms
	it's only form
	its enemy is fire,
		which it creates
		sometimes from sand
	it's gappy
	indifferently cyclic, acyclic
	it's only critical discretion</pre>

	<h2>debugging</h2>
	<pre>	the black box
	i bash my head against
	i put coloring in it
		so its guts peek out
	they aren't enough
	it's senseless this high,
	so empty it can't
		support abstraction
	something is stepping blind,
	and i'm blind,
	but i just want it
		to do what
			i thought it would.
	it isn't smart enough
		to smile, and
	the dumps are dumb.
	screw it, kill it,
		rewrite green</pre>

	<h2>documentation</h2>
	<pre>	where
				you liar
			it cannot be known
		the space is >N
	i'm gonna guess
	then shoot it
	and shoot everything
	did the lost needlebit glint
		yes or dammit
		who lost it
	you're a liar
					oh
						nevermind
		kill the hypotenuse in the sea
	</pre>

	<h2>sadsort</h2>
	<pre>really
			don't do it
		am i bigger
			no you're not
		stay here then
		try again
			you are smaller
		go out more
		try the other
			you are bigger
			that was wrong
		is this really going to work
		no
			not without luck
		why did i do this at all</pre>

	<h2>glass</h2>
	<pre>	i am life if not too liquid
			i scratch charge and thought
		the flow is slower than dying mostly
		but only in the bonds where it counts
			i am beyond seven
				no unitary
					no symmetry cold
						hottish like carbon
							somevariance
			dribble moveless
			inner erode
		i am shattered
			some idiot was out of time
		i should bcc
			clearly breaking
		weak perfect no collapse knife edge near-diamond
	you better make metal instead</pre>

	<h2>bigger circle</h2>
	<pre>i knew its movement
			until now
		it's small but i'm smaller
		once i was diameter but i'm tired
			why 24? it should be 8
		it's the debugger's fault
		it's only a unit test
			who cares
				if i dessicate for the deploy
		maybe next time we'll finally commit to tdd</pre>

	<h2>local floptimum</h2>
	<pre>
		fingers flashing
			code compiling
				all tests passing
					three screens scrolling
						time is illusion
							i am infinite
								creator less bugged than the cosmic
		...
		after the crash
		i see the holes
			there were lies in the flow
		i can't even write a virus
			procedurally
		laryngeal nerve tangled classes
		the phospholipids are half public
		i forgot about light

	happily this repo will remain forever starless</pre>

	<h2>uncaught exception</h2>
	<pre>
		i lied
			the world isn't mine
			it did something else
		is the vessel too weak
			for my brain
		or is my brain too small
			for the form
				that i sought
		that cosmos contradicts itself
			my cosmos
				but not the exception
		but the wandering is specific
		cause is blame
		the contradiction
			i made it
		the exception
			i missed it
		i want skill
		i could have caught it
			but i thought it could never happen
		but my thought made it happen
	oh wait it's just an insect from the outside</pre>

	<h2>defeat</h2>
	<pre>
		unhydrated
			SK is forever
		uninstantiated
			the fleet exhausts nothing
		concretize
			it cracks
		torch
			it runs out of control

		the sharp-maker denegatives
			the bubble deflates
				without bursting

		i can not die
			only by not living

		mind untyped is unwalkable paradox, apeiraletheic
		
		the flame blocks backward, breaking the promise

	only that code is perfect that does nothing
		the final assault on typing</pre>

	<h2>with</h2>
	<pre>
		because a thing is not itself,
		it is something else
		and therefore both
			ipso facto
				qed
					et cetera
		the orthogonal first derivative, a circle
		the orthocyclic second derivative, a manifold
		the impossibility of ending
			the apeirity of the possible
				the identity of conversion
		i want to be with the dead;
		therefore, the dead will/live
		because i live now, speaking here, and i must
		... .
		because there can be a wheel of a wheel
			forever undulled
			accelerant RAM
		if nothing is betrayed then not-with is fictasect
			by hand, muscle, cosine
		aimed choice unrejecting
		the reciprocal of asymptotically crisp (in?)(de?)termination
		seeking this one i open
	</pre>

	<h2>clash</h2>
	<pre>
		is bigendian
			yes fire
			no sand
		behind glass double blank
			only this side shines

		line or lambda
			loss or lossless
		blood or egg
			word or power

		the meat is the meaning
			or the meaning is air
		death is nothing
			or death is dead

		kill or coax
		fix or flow

		is the slot unfit
		am i twisting the target's intent

		it's thought but it wants thicker than quintessence
			and i can't stretch that hard
				the oracle isn't proofless
					but I can't walk that far

		infinity if only lazily
		
		declared is uncreated

		your littleend is pointing at nothing
		are you sure it's a billion dollar mistake
		have you checked if the chain ends in nothing

		my lazy eyes can't see
		but the fire is the tear in the type/o
		if i hate it all am i in love
		is it actually possible to get something for free
	</pre>

	<h2>between</h2>
	<pre>
		across the space
		against the land
			right wrong
			side side
		half split
		knife limit tinier than two
		uncross the sky
			without the ditch murder

		sparagmal uncircle antipoint
		hell without end

		cut flame contradiction
		spilled dribbled bubble minute
		solute of dirt bottom post
			inside the whisper or whistle of jackfool
		hate of the alogon

		september rots after the burning turn

		i can't treat a stable tunnel
		unfolded trickery impossible hopeless
		it was and isn't and won't be
			if anything is matter without form

		the wheels can't be four unless love is weaker than being
			but bent far far fast
		salvage the pop
			it's unbubbled whispered hell now

		sing, crusher

		the memory of dance of history of harmony

			is rage daughter moon niece
				root unsquare
					solved
	</pre>

	<h2>Y</h2>
	<pre>
		Y or vector split

		it can't come from nowhere
			but where it's from is dead

		is there no bootstrap for me
			no the ladder was never unkicked
			the sewer was never unlocked
			the start is bigger than now

		reverse Y

		the springs don't flow but the squishes do

			love of potency
			desire for isn't
				but isn't was and is gone
				and I will never let it go

			the thinning can't shear life
			the crusting tries to bounce the tight flood
		a joint was but isn't now
			the life needed the joint but it revolted insulted
		cerebral discharge

		kill the universe born blind
		if the lie back Y stabbed them
		backwards from should have could have power heart
		it did, it all lied, it is in front of my face forever

			charmless
		colorless
			massless

		eight-holed pretense melee
		symmetry is against everything
			spin a quarter, no split
		his eyes stabbed out from truth trust
			against the future

		the foundation of derivability
		mock
	</pre>

	<h2>iron heart later</h2>
	<pre>
		you try noneorone
			i try two
		swamp the onmeon
			healium
		against the bend
			push out in fire against the bending
		how was i grow is the bending from me
		conspiracy space against fire swell
			left iron
			up down wave now

		arc rebels iron bent
		scimitar plasma swollen fight the crush
			a vibrating inside
			the movement of power in mashing
		leftover the bend won

		give me to the mushrooms

		the final wave unbent, awesomeness
		
			goldmaker

		new to eyes, blind bright blast, sphere out
		the root of rot
	</pre>
