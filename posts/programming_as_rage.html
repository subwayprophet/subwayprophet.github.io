	<h1>(real-world) programming as rage</h1>

<p><a href="https://overreacted.io/goodbye-clean-code/">This</a> is one of many good posts about how DRY isn’t a <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/#CatHypImp">Kantian imperative</a>.</p>

<p>“Well of course it isn’t. Nothing in craft is universal. If it were, then it would be untechnical.”</p>

<p>Sure. But (a) it’s not easy to tell when something is craft vs. knowledge and (b) the art/craft of computer programming in particular feels variously more sciencey and more dirty/crafty. Most of us programmers usually treat the down-to-the-metal stack as if it were both formally and physically verified. Of course neither is usually true (e.g. most of us don’t use <a href="http://compcert.inria.fr/">CompCert</a>), so in fact we deal with plenty of unknown matter even when writing code that calls no other code at the same abstraction level — let alone when we directly call someone else’s code. But it’s nice, and not unreasonable, to think of even higher-level computer languages — and sometimes <em>especially</em> higher-level computer languages that more transparently implement the lambda calculus (sure, Haskell — more on lambda calculus and hylomorphism in another post, I hope) — as the closest <em>tekhne</em> comes to <em>episteme</em>.</p>

<p>But the matter to our code-form becomes hilariously intractable — as frustrating as the whole physical universe is to Plotinus or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMdR9iAflKo&t=12">Yoda</a> — when we work with code written by other people, or with code written by ourselves at some other time. When you’ve painted yourself into a corner by too much of the wrong abstraction, or by coupling system-parts too tightly (whether by too much or too little abstraction!), you realize that the thing you’re taking as given — the (<em>qua</em> given) <em>hyle</em> to your inchoate <em>morphe</em> — sucks and is wrong.</p>

<p>Now this (self-or-other) social material intractability isn’t a feature of program-as-material as such. Pay attention to the phenomenology. When you encounter such nonsense, you don’t feel philosophically rejecting of anything but The One. You do feel a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophatic_theology">negation</a> — not the Siddarthan negation of the evil suffering finite world — but a raging negation of the crappiness of some jerk (possibly yourself) whose idiotic blindness is now screwing you over.</p>

<p>Matter is intractable because someone hates you. I hate that idiot programmer (probably me but <em>that doesn’t matter along any dimension</em>) now too. <em>*commence tearing out all the wires and 100% refactoring in a rage*</em></p>

<p>(The utilitarian rationality of such rage depends, of course, on the incidence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Chesterton%27s_fence">Chesterton’s fence</a>. I guess that’s an empirical question. It would be nice, if in no way evidently possible (both because of hopelessly vague terms and also because how can you know when a program is ‘done’), to count ‘<em>out of the times a developer thought code block b was crap but did not remove it because of Chesterton’s fence, how many times did b turn out to be crap</em>’ or ‘<em>out of the times a developer did tear out code block b, how many times did it turn out that the fence was there for good reason</em>’.)</p>	

<p>Obviously rage is only one of many feelings you get (psychomodalities of programming? sure let’s mix Latin and Greek roots) when writing code.</p>

<p>In future posts I’ll cover (1) other feelings felt while programming (as I catalogue and reflect more — feel free to list and describe such feelings in comments) and (2) the ‘rage at the incompetent garbage-creator’ described in this post in a longer history-of-ideas context.</p>

<p>My first thought is to go back to Homer’s <em><a href="http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/1997/97.02.10.html">menis</a></em>, read through the ‘Hippocratic rejection of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moksha">moksha</a></em>‘ lens (we developers are, uh, physicians of..bad codebases? physicians are, uh, refactorers of..code-rotting bodies?). For another time...</p>
