	<h1>poems</h1>

	<h2>programmer god</h2>
	<pre>no triangle
		no entry
	instead a filter
		bracket pointy down
	not build, but discipline
	reduce to act,
		no creating
	the engineer
		over the demiurge
	as if from plenum,
		the axiom of the lambda
		derivation is humility,
		analysis is complete making
	i kill with names,
		saturating boxes
		determining void,
		and with a poke
			the thing runs itself</pre>

	<h2>silicon trickle</h2>
	<pre>it isn't from me
		or anything
	it always bootstraps
	and its condition is no exit
		except arbitrarily
	a function is a thing
	an action is an object
	it's combinators
		all the way down
	i'm not a channel
	it's less than atoms
	it's only form
	its enemy is fire,
		which it creates
		sometimes from sand
	it's gappy
	indifferently cyclic, acyclic
	it's only critical discretion</pre>

	<h2>debugging</h2>
	<pre>	the black box
	i bash my head against
	i put coloring in it
		so its guts peek out
	they aren't enough
	it's senseless this high,
	so empty it can't
		support abstraction
	something is stepping blind,
	and i'm blind,
	but i just want it
		to do what
			i thought it would.
	it isn't smart enough
		to smile, and
	the dumps are dumb.
	screw it, kill it,
		rewrite green</pre>
